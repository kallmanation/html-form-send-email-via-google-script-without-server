# Since coinhive has gone out of business, this no longer works

~# Send Email from a *Static* HTML Form using Google Apps Mail, with Coinhive proof of work captcha~

~A built out version of the tutorial given here: https://github.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server~

~What I've added: [Coinhive Captcha](https://coinhive.com/documentation/captcha) and a honeypot to the html along with validating code to the `google-apps-script` to ensure the sender actually completed the captcha.~

~You can see a live example of this working here: https://forms.kallmanation.com/~
