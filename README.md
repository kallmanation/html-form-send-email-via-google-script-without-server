# Send Email from a *Static* HTML Form using Google Apps Mail, with Coinhive proof of work captcha

A built out version of the tutorial given here: https://github.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server

What I've added: [Coinhive Captcha](https://coinhive.com/documentation/captcha) and a honeypot to the html along with validating code to the `google-apps-script` to ensure the sender actually completed the captcha.
